# Workshop generating ideas for programming with chatgpt


Once again, with the help of 4 Geeks Academy, we bring you a workshop where the idea was to create an application that makes use of ChatGpt to generate ideas for applications to program ourselves. In other words, a solution to the typical "I don't know what to program" in order to continue practicing or growing our portfolios and, consequently, our skills.

To make the idea more interesting, we have added the option for the user to decide what they want ideas to be generated about (for example, ideas related to utility applications, cooking, etc.) and the option to generate a code proposal that will be in the programming language or framework that has been previously selected.

The ultimate goal of the workshop is to promote and show how Artificial Intelligence tools (in this case, Github Copilot) can be used to generate applications.



### Project dependencies:

- NodeJs to start our project (npx create-react-app)
- An active OpenAi API KEY



### Attention

The project has been generated, as seen in the associated video, 99% of its entirety using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Github Copilot



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
